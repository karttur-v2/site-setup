The name of a post file must start with a date followed by a hyphen (“-“) using this format:   YYYY-MM-DD-file_name.md   _config.yml and front matter   Posts are mostly used for blogs that are published over time and should have both date, title and preferably also an excerpt key in the post file front matter (otherwise the first paragraph is used as excerpt - see the Jekyll document on Posts):   title:  \"Posts in Jekyll: 1. basics\" excerpt: \"How to set front matter in Jekyll posts and basic options for layout and content using the theme Minimal Mistakes.\" date: 2024-09-20 12:13:03 +0200 last_modified_at: 2024-09-20 12:13:03 +0200   The keys for date and last_modified_at are optional, but I prefer to include them to keep track of when I made the latest changes. For more details on displaying post dates see the Minimal Mistakes posts Layout: Post Date Enabled and Layout: Post Date Disabled.   For posts, the author of the theme Minimal Mistakesrecommends the following settings in _config.yml (I added the show_date key):   defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true       show_date: true       read_time: true       share: true       related: true   Transferred to the front matter of the posts document itself this becomes:   layout: single author_profile: true show_date: true read_time: true share: true related: true   Combined with the post local keys, the complete front matter then becomes:   layout: single author_profile: true read_time: true share: true related: true title:  \"Posts in Jekyll: 1. basics\" excerpt: \"How to set front matter in Jekyll posts and basic options for layout and content using the theme Minimal Mistakes.\" date:   2024-09-20 12:13:03 +0200 last_modified_at: 2024-09-20 12:13:03 +0200   Key values set in the posts file front matter has precedence over values set in _config.yml if a key:value pair is set in both.   Posts usually also have keys for categories and tags. Each post can belong to multiple categories and have multiple tags. In the theme Minimal Mistakes, the categories and tags are shown towards the end of a post.   Table of content   To set a table of content in a post, follow the same syntax as outlined for pages.

The previous post showed how to set the key categories in the front matter of a post file:   layout: single author_profile: true itle:  \"Posts in Jekyll: 1. basics\" excerpt: \"How to set front matter in Jekyll posts and basic options for layout and content using the theme Minimal Mistakes.\" date:   2024-09-20 12:13:03 +0200 last_modified_at:   2024-09-24 12:13:03 +0200 categories:   - jekyllposts tags:   - jekyll   - minimal mistakes  You do not need to set any category, but you can also set any number of categories you wish, e.g:   ... categories:   - jekyllposts   - mmistakes ...   Categories is a hierarchical way to group posts together. That it is a grouping mechanism is probably obvious. But that it is achieved by a hierarchy is not very clear. When a site is generated (bundle exec jekyll serve) the order of the categories determine the structure of the site. For example, the filename of this post is  YYYY-MM-DD-jekyll_posts02-categories.md   When generated as a static page, the html file (that is always named index.html) will be created in a sub-folder:   jekyll_posts02-categories/index.html   If your front matter does not define any categories (or permalink), the sub-folder will end up directly under the root:   ./jekyll_posts02-categories/index.html   If you have a single categories defined (like for this very post), the sub-folder will end up in a folder named as this single categories:   ./jekyllposts/jekyll_posts02-categories/index.html   If you have two (or more) categories listed in the front matter a complete hierarchy following the order of the categories will be generated. For the example above with two categories, the path (url) to the site html file will thus be:   ./jekyllposts/mmistakes/jekyll_posts02-categories/index.html   Forcing a URL   If you want to customise the organisation of the urls of your posts you force the path under the root by setting the key permalink in the post front matter. The following permalink key:   permalink: /jekyllsposts/2_categories/   will force this file to the path:   ./jekyllsposts/2_categories/index.html   For details on setting permalink in the _config.yml, please visit the Jekyll doc Permalinks.   Excluding a post from publication   You can exclude any individual post from being published with the site by setting the key published to false (not illustrated!):   published: false   Gather posts with same categories   You can use Jekyll’s extended Liquid language for gathering posts that share a categories item. The posts front page of this blog explains how this is done.   Resources   This blog - 1. basics   Jekyll - Permalinks   Liquid   ","categories": ["jekyllposts"],

        "excerpt":"Minimal Mistakes layouts   The Jekyll theme Minimal Mistakes comes with more than a dozen prepared layouts. The differences between these layouts are described in the Minimal Mistakes documentation Layouts.   The recommendation from Michael Rose, the author of Minimal Mistakes, is to use the Layout single both for pages and posts.   Minimal Mistakes layouts   The template GitHub repository of the Jekyll Minimal Mistakes theme contains these layouts.      archive   archive-taxonomy   categories   category   collection   compress   default   home   posts   search   single   splash   tag   tags   The Minimal Mistakes documents explain the diffrences between these layouts. Below is a summary of the main types.   Archive layout   Essentially the same as single with markup adjustments and some modules removed. For details see Minimal Mistakes - Archive layouts.   Home page layout   A derivative archive page layout to be used as a simple home page. It is built to show a paginated list of recent posts based off of the pagination settings in _config.yml. The html root document for this entire site is built using the layout home. The bottom of that document lists the posts by default. For details the the Minimal Mistakes docs on home page layout.   Splash page layout   The splash layout generated full width pages without margins but three equally wide feature blocks. The Minimal Mistakes layout document contains a detailed section on Splash page layout. The next post in this blog is built using splash.   Search page layout   Search page layout is a page with a search form included by default as explained in the Minimal Mistakes section on Search page layout. A search layout document is typically a pages scope (rather than a post).   Front matter customisation   This section covers the layout customisations that can be done using keys in the front matter. By default the layout single, that we mostly have used so far, have the following front matter layout options:   # Top banner image (as in this post) header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"More Info\"       url: \"https://unsplash.com\"  # left column author profile (as in this post): author_profile: boolean [true/false]  # left column Navigation bar sidebar :   nav: \"'navbarname'\"  # right column table of content layout: toc : [true/false] toc_label: string toc_icon: path to icon toc_sticky: [true/false] (true = stick to top of screen)  # Concatenation of central and right columns # If combine dwith toc, toc is mobed to the top of the concatenated column classes: wide  # comments module comments: boolean [true/false]  # social media sharing share: boolean [true/false]  # related posts related: boolean [true/false]  # show date show_date: boolean [true/false]  # read time read_time: boolean [true/false]  # Disqus (I have to understand this to write anything) ???   Sidebars   The Minimal Mistakes default layout consists of a central main column with two sidebars; a left sidebar that can host author details and/or a customised navigation bar, and a right sidebar where a table of content can be added. The Minimal Mistakes layout documents include details about the Sidebars.   The right margin of the layout single is by default reserved for a table of content (see the post on pages in this site). You can free space for the main content (central column) by setting the key classes to wide in the front matter of the file you want customise:   classes: wide   If you have also requested a toc:   classes: wide toc: true   The table of contents will appear in the new, concatenated, central column just after the title and any show_date or read_time.   Custom head and footer   The Minimal Mistakes documents include hints for how to create Custom head and footer.

If you are using macOS more detailed instructions for checking and installing both Ruby version managers and Ruby itself are published by Daniel Kehoe in a blog on installing Ruby on MacOS.   Check pre-installed version   MacOS comes with a pre-installed version of Ruby. You can check the version installed by open a terminal window and write the command ruby -v. Hit return to execute the command.   If you are not sure if you have already installed Ruby, execute the terminal command which -a ruby.

At time of writing this, November 2024, the latest Ruby version is 3.3.6, updating in March 2025 it is instead 3.4.2.

Installing Homebrew is fairly easy and explained on the home page.   Once Homebrew is installed you can go on to install Ruby. But you have to make up your mind if you want a bare-bone installation or if you prefer to use a software version manager.   Before continuing I recommend that you update Homebrew with the following sequence of commands:   brew update brew upgrade brew outdated brew cleanup brew doctor   Ruby version managers   When I built the first version of Karttur’s website, I used Homebrew and Ruby Version Manager RVM. Since then more alternatives have become available. Apart from RVM, there are Asdf, Chruby and Frum, and more, version managers available. The ones mentioned above can all be installed via Homebrew.   Having tried out RVM and [Chruby][Chruby], and run into troubles with updating individual gem packages, I found the blog on Installing Ruby on MacOS by Daniel Kehoe. I recommend using Daniel’s site for your macOS installation of Ruby.   Install Chruby   Following the recommendation by Daniel Kehoe and the [official Jekyll page][jekyll-Chruby] I selected Chruby as my Ruby version manager. Install Chruby using Homebrew:   brew install Chruby ruby-install   The terminal window reports the progress and tells you what to do once finished. Below is a summary of the commands you should run:   ... Add the following to the ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc file:   source /usr/local/opt/&lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;/share/&lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;.sh ... To enable auto-switching of Rubies specified by .ruby-version files, add the following to ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc:   source /usr/local/opt/&lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;/share/&lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;/auto.sh ...   More recent macOS version use zsh as default. To check the active shell, run the command:   echo $SHELL   If the response is   /bin/zsh   your machine uses zsh and the line above should be added to the file ~/.zshrc. Add the lines reported in the Terminal to the correct file. Then close and reopen the terminal window for the command to take effect.   To check that Chruby was installed properly:  % chruby -h usage: chruby [RUBY|VERSION|system] [RUBYOPT...]   If you get a response (like the one above) you can check which version of Chruby that was installed by:   % chruby&lt;/span&gt; --version chruby: 0.3.9   Check Ruby versions under Chruby   With Chruby installed check which Ruby versions are installed:   % chruby * ruby-3.4.2   Update Ruby version under Chruby   You can check the latest available Ruby version at  https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/  To install the latest, or any previous version, of Ruby under Chruby:   ruby-install ruby-3.4.7   You might need to restart the terminal before your system recognises the new Ruby version. If you have stated the Ruby version to use in your shell configuration file (e.g. .zshrc) you also need to change the version stated there. Rerun the &lt;span class=”Chruby”&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to see that the newly installed version is available and set as active:   % &lt;span class=\"terminalapp\"&gt;Chruby&lt;/span&gt;    ruby-3.4.2  * ruby 3.4.7   Resources   Howebrew   RVM   Asdf   Chruby   Frum   blog on installing Ruby on MacOS   ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Regardless if you used a Ruby version manager or a bare-bone installation (see previous document), you should keep your Ruby environment and its gems updated when you start a new project.   The way to keep track of and update gems varies dependent on your Ruby installation route. You can install or upgrade gems individually, or apply a gem manager to update all gems in one go.   At the time of installing chruby and Ruby in March 2025 on macOS, I had trouble with installing gems. I had to rebuild my setup several times. There are bugs in some combinations of Ruby versus gem versions. This apparently changed frequently as the system develop and new versions are released. It is thus not possible to give any detailed instructions, and the following suggestions are only indicative ideas for how to solve errors with versions.   Individual gem updates   The default command for updating a Ruby gem is to run the terminal command   gem install &lt;gem&gt;   This command, however, is primarily meant for the system default Ruby installation and not the Homebrew installation. Some Ruby managers (e.g. chruby), however, capture the above command and will install the gem with the linked chruby version of Ruby.   For Homebrew installed Ruby, the command for installing individual gems is instead brew-gem. For using that you have to first install brew-gem:   brew install brew-gem   Then use the Terminal to install individual gems via Homebrew:   brew-gem install &lt;gem&gt; --homebrew-ruby   You can also upgrade gems via Homebrew:   brew-gem upgrade &lt;gem&gt; --homebrew-ruby   For more information see the page Managing Ruby Gems using Homebrew.   Update using gem manager   This section was largely taken from the post Update Gems by Daniel Kehoe.   Check if your system comes with a gem manager by issuing the terminal command:   gem -v   If your command returns a version number, go ahead and update gem   gem update --system   Use the gem manager to list your gems:   gem list  *** LOCAL GEMS ***  ...  If you later want to make sure that your gems were updates, save the listed gems.   To check which gems are outdated:  gem outdated ...  You can also save this list for later if you want to control the result of the updating.   I had some outdated gems, and updated all of them in one go:   gem update Updating installed gems ...   If you saved the list of gems prior to the update, you can now rerun the gem list command and check out that the outdated gems were updated.

Fork the Jekyll theme so-simple   Go to the Jekyll theme So-simple GitHub page and Fork the So-simple repository.   so-simple_fork.png   jekyll theme setup   You now have three options for using the Jekyll theme So-simple for your web-pages.     install the theme as a Ruby gem,   install as a remote theme, or   customise a Ruby gem theme.   Which alternative to use depends on, i) if you want to customise the layout and functions, and ii) if you plan to publish as (free) GitHub pages or self-hosting.   Install theme as a Ruby gem (gem based theme)   This options is the best for self-hosting with no customisation.   Edit Gemfile   The root folder of the forked (or downloaded) theme folder contains a file named Gemfile (with no extension). Open that file and add the line:   gem \"jekyll-theme-so-simple\"   The complete content of Gemfile should then become:   source \"https://rubygems.org\" gem \"jekyll-theme-so-simple\"   Edit _config.yml   You also need to edit a second file in the root folder, _config.yml.

You should then see the content of your site as a web-page.   Install theme as a remote (GitHub) theme   This options is the best for hosting your pages on GitHub.   Edit Gemfile   The root folder of the forked (or downloaded) theme folder contains a file named Gemfile (with no extension). Open that file and add the line:   gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins   The complete content of Gemfile should then become:   source \"https://rubygems.org\" gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins   Run the terminal command bundle update to verify that all required gems are installed.   bundle update   The information returned indicate that some of the gems are outdated and need to be replaces. Just leave that for the time being and accept the installation as it is.   Edit _config.yml   You also need to edit a second file in the root folder, _config.yml. Search for the text string “remote_theme:” and make sure that the line defining the theme is not commented out (i.e. do not start with a hashtag), while the line defining “theme:” is commented out with a hashtag.

Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.   Jekyll serve   You should now be able to use Jekyll to create a local server and view the site (theme) content in your web browser. Write the following command at the Terminal prompt:   bundle exec jekyll serve   If you just forked the original So-simple jekyll theme there will be quite a lot of warnings as the page comes with examples and links that are meant to be edited. The first error preventing the theme to serve up:   Liquid Exception: Syntax Error in tag 'highlight' while parsing the following markup: Valid syntax: highlight &lt;lang&gt; [linenos] in CHANGELOG.md   I simply opened the file CHANGELOG.md in the root of the theme site and changed the liquid tag to simple text:   - Replace \"highlight\" tags with GitHub Flavored Markdown backticks.   Retrying bundle exec jekyll serve I get another error:   Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error (line 325): 'for' tag was never closed in README-OLD.md   The file README-OLD.md contains a commented for liquid on line 163 that causes the error. I change that line to:   {percent for post in site.categories.blog percent}   With these changes the jekyll theme So-simple serves up and the terminal report:   Generating...

Customise a Ruby gem theme   The last option is to create a customised theme by copying and editing the theme default files to your local site (repository).   Start by following the section above on Install theme as a Ruby gem (gem based theme).   The Jekyll theme will always look for local definition files, i.e. under the root of the theme’s local site. Only if a theme definition file is not available locally, Jekyll will look for the default theme gem and its content. To override the default gem you just simply copy the default gem file to the local site and edit the copy of the file in the local site.   The official Jekyll site includes a section on Overriding theme defaultsPermalink including how to locate the gem theme you want to apply on your local machine. For locating So-Simple theme on macOS run the terminal command   bundle info –path jekyll-theme-so-simple   /Users/thomasgumbricht/.gem/ruby/3.4.2/gems/jekyll-theme-so-simple-3.2.0   ","categories": [],

Following the instructions Update Gems, by the same site used above for chruby setup, just update the gems with the command:   gem update --system gem update   To check the results of the update, list the gems:   gem list   To list outdated gems:   To overcome this, I first need to install brew-gem:   brew install brew-gem   Now you can replace the gem command above with:   brew gem install \"rexml\", \"&gt;= 3.3.9\"   or   brew gem install rexml   or   brew gem upgrade rexml   I also had to upgrade the gem webrick.   To take effect, you must restart the terminal after the installation or upgrade.   But that did not work out, listing my intalled gems with the command:   gem list   The latest installe versions are not reflected in the list and I get the same security warnings.

    "excerpt":"Pages - a quick tutorial      Create the pages document in the folder _pages, name it logically,   set pages primary keys either:            in _config.yml, or       as front matter in the pages document itself,           set the path to the new pages document front matter as the parameter permalink,   set the parameter title in the front matter,   add other options in the front matter, including overriding the _config.yml defaults.   For more details read on or visit the Jekyll document on Pages.   This article itself is an example of a page, created using the theme Minimal Mistakes.   Pages   As pages are unitary documents, unassociated with other documents in the same site, they are typically published in separate sub-folders (= sub-directories). Sub-folders that contain only a single index.html file. The path to the sub-folder from the site root is typically given in the front matter by the key (parameter) permalink. This also means that a pages markdown document can be put anywhere, it is the parameter permalink that defines where the resulting html file ends up in the published web-site. One example is to put the about.markdown document in the root folder, but set its permalink to either pages or about.   _config.yml and front matter   To be linked properly the front matter of a page only needs to contain keys for permalink and a title:   permalink: /jekyllpages/ title: \"Pages in Jekyll\"   For the theme Minimal Mistakes this is the recommended setting for pages in _config.yml:   defaults:   # _pages   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true   Transferred to the front matter of the pages document itself this becomes:   layout: single author_profile: true   Combined with the permalink and title keys, the complete front matter then becomes:   layout: single author_profile: true permalink: /jekyllpages/ title: \"Pages in Jekyll\"   Key values set in the pages file front matter has precedence over values set in _config.yml if a key:value pair is set in both.   Table of content   Editing _config.yml you can add additional elements, like a table of content (toc) as in this example page:   defaults:   # _pages   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true       toc: true   Minimal Mistakes even allows you to set the title and logo for the toc.   You can also add the key toc for individual pages documents:   layout: single author_profile: true permalink: /jekyllpages/ title: \"Pages in Jekyll\" toc:true   Again, if the toc key is set in both the _config.yml and the document own front matter, the latter will take precedence.   Linking to your pages   In this example the index.html generated from the pages.md file will end up in the site under the path:   ./jekyllpages/index.html   This url is not linked to your site root (front/home) page. The options for directing site visitors to your single page include:      as a main menu item,   adding a customised sidebar navigation,  or   as an explicit url link in the root page (or any page on your site).   Main menu   The main menu is defined in the file ./_data/navigation.yml.   If your site does not contain the file ./_data/navigation.yml it is instead found in the “gem” that your jekyll theme is based on. To find the “gem”, open the terminal that contains your site and execute the command:   $ bundle info minimal-mistakes.   The terminal should then report something like:   * minimal-mistakes-jekyll (4.26.2) Summary: A flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Homepage: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes Path: /Users/thomasgumbricht/.gem/ruby/3.3.5/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-4.26.2   under the reported path look for  ./_data/navigation.yml   Copy this file to your site and the local copy will take precedence over the “gem” file. You can now edit the local copy of navigation.yml to have the following main menu:   # main links main:   - title: \"About\"     url: /about/   - title: \"Front\"     url: /   - title: \"Pages\"     url: /jekyllpages/   To add tooltips that appear when the mouse is hoovered over the menu item, edit navigation.yml and add description keys:   # main links main:   - title: \"About\"     url: /about/     description: about Karttur   - title: \"Front\"     url: /     description: Site root   - title: \"Pages\"     url: /jekyllpages/     description: jekyll pages as part of your site   Custom sidebar navigation   Minimal Mistakes allows you to add a customised sidebar navigation. This requires three steps:     name the custom navigation and list the links,   edit navigation.yml with the name and the links, and   add the name in either the front matter of individual files or in _config.yml.   Here is an example of a customised navigation, named jekylldocs, linking to three different urls:   jekylldocs:   - title: Jekyll doc system     children:       - title: \"Pages\"         url: /jekyllpages/       - title: \"Posts\"         url: /jekyllposts/       - title: \"Collections\"         url: /jekyllcollections/   The above code should be written to the local site copy of navigation.yml.   Then add the following lines to the front matter of the files where you want the sidebar navigation to appear:   sidebar:   nav: \"jekylldocs\"   The complete front matter then becomes something like:   layout: single author_profile: true permalink: /jekyllpages/ title: \"Pages in Jekyll\" excerpt: \"How to set front matter in Jekyll pages and options for pages layout and content using the theme Minimal Mistakes.\"  sidebar:   nav: \"jekylldocs\"   I add my customisations at the end of the front matter (or _config.yml), including a comment. In that way I can find them easily if I want to remove, change or transfer my customisations to new versions of Jekyll or Minimal Mistakes.   Alternatively edit _config.yml defaults:   ... defaults:   # _pages   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true       toc: true       sidebar:         nav: \"jekylldocs\" ...   Explicit url link   The last option for linking to a single pages document is to use an explicitly written html tag linking to Pages in Jekyll:   [Pages in Jekyll](jekyllpages)   Or, using the latest Jekyll syntax that assembles all explicit urls in markdown (.md) files:   [Pages in Jekyll][jekyllpages] ... ...

To end up in the root directory of the posts categorised as jekyllposts, the front matter key permalink is set to /jekyllposts/.
